# KungFuCircle

**What is the Kung Fu Circle?**

The "Kung Fu Circle" is a combat system that manages how NPCs will engage the player during fights in order to make the game less punishing and fast paced. 
This system is usually applied for games that try to make the combat flow in a more cinematic way and for fights with a big amount of enemies.
Spiderman and Batman Arkham Asylum are the two games that I took as guidance in developing my implementation of this technique.
